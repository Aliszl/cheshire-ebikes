            Pedal assist bikes that help you zip along at about 15mph require no
            licence, no insurance and no tax. They are regarded in law exactly
            the same as a regular bicycle. Helmets are recommended but are not a
            legal requirement. As with regular bikes lights are required at
            night, but not during day light. Hi-viz clothing isn't essential
            either.
